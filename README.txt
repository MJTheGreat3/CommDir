The project I have created titled, Community Directory, is meant to serve as a record of members of a particular community, old and new, and can help in storing and 
determining essential details about these members. Also, this directory can prove to be integral in minimising effort in the distribution and collection of information 
and data. Furthermore, it can easily be modified to serve similar purposes for other institutions such as schools, universities, clubs, residential societies, 
NGOs (non-governmental organisations), etc. 

My Church publishes a Parish Directory every few years, but it becomes outdated pretty soon because of people changing phone numbers or shifting to new residences, etc. 
To solve this, I have made a virtual version of this directory. The start page is the homepage where you would be able to see 2 options of logging in as an admin or as a 
member. As of now, these are the 2 hierarchical positions in this web application.

The admins have the right to: 
1. register families 
2. view members 
3. edit members 
4. add members 
5. activate and deactivate members 
6. reset the members’ passwords 
7. change their own passwords. 

However, the members can only: 
1. view other members 
2. change their own passwords. 

In this directory, members are represented in families. Each family has its own registration number and password with which any member of that particular family can log in 
to their account. On the other hand, admins log in through a separate username and a password. After successfully logging in, the user is directed to the directorial page 
which is the page where every family member is shown. In this page, some basic information about the members is given against each one’s name which includes registration 
number, name, family name, zone, address and activity. On clicking alongside ‘view’ button will redirect the user to that specific member’s family portfolio. The portfolio 
is the place which defines all the information about the family. Members can be added to this family through this page. Other actions can also be carried out. For example, 
resetting a family’s password in case the family members forget it, editing information about a family/member and deactivation or reactivation of members due to any reasons. 
All these functions are available only for the admin and not for the members. In addition to this admins have a button named ‘register’ on the header through which they can 
register a family under a particular person’s name. Also, both the members and the admin have the option of changing their own passwords on the header. 

So, in a nutshell, my project is a virtual account manager for a particular institution, which in this case is a Church.
